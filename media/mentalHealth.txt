Mental Health Awareness Month: I have schizoaffective bipolar type and I just graduated with my BA in English (Magna Cum Laude) at age 28 after dropping out of high school and having intermittently relapsed into psychosis for a duration of 8 hospitalizations. With loving support success is possible
Not to brag, but instead of laying in bed ALL day, I laid in bed for MOST of the day, then got up and took a shower. Next up, I conquer the world.
Thank you to the woman who rang me out at Target. You saved my life üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs been 2 months to the day since I last self harmed. I just want someone to be proud of me.
PREACH
I made a suicide scale. Hoping it could help others.
To the man who saved my life and never knew
i‚Äôm 365 days clean from selfharm baby
Anyone else procrastinate going to sleep because they don‚Äôt want the next day to come, but then also get anxious about how many hours they have left before they need to get up?
Want an emotional support animal but can't have one? Get a stuffed animal.
To the person who deleted their post few minutes ago.
My wife has passed suddenly
I survived a school shooting, but now I can‚Äôt do anything
My doctor asked ‚ÄúDo you even want to get better?‚Äù in response to me saying I‚Äôm not in therapy because I can‚Äôt afford it
There is an Arabic saying and it goes like this:
Does anyone else have random thoughts pop in your head about something you did years ago and get a sudden wave of guilt and feel like shit for hours?
Today I'm glad I didn't kill myself yesterday.
I got out of bed today :)
3 weeks clean. I've painted every time I had a major craving. I'm up to 95 canvases. So an average of 4.5 a day.
Does anyone else feel super motivated and ambitious late at night or around bedtime, and then waking up with absolutely none of those feelings?
My Dad shot himself today..
I was inches from committing suicide 6 months ago, today I signed a lease for the nicest apartments in my city. Hang in there.

To anyone suicidal tonight, look up the Rappper NF. All he raps about is how to face mental health. He's saved my life many times.
Anyone else feeling very behind everyone their age. Like they're accomplishing all these things and I'm just here.
I don't have a lot of people in my life right now, but i wanted to share this: I chose life this morning. I chose my raggedy, rundown broken life. I chose me. And I think I chose well.
1 YEAR TODAY WITH NO ATTEMPT SUICIDE AND A MAJOR EPISODE
Me irl
If you‚Äôre the woman who took my call 7 years ago on the suicide hotline-
Depression does NOT mean feeling sad. Depression is a medical term for functioning below necessary levels
People who welcome you back with open arms after ghosting them during a severe depressive episode are like gold
Just because you‚Äôre struggling doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre failing. Big shout out to all in the community who made it through another day. You‚Äôre all amazing. You got this.
TODAY I AM 5 YEARS SELF HARM FREE
You are not lazy, losing interest in a loved activity could be a warning sign
I think that ‚Äú13 reasons why‚Äù is a very bad way of ‚Äúspreading awareness‚Äù
Today marks 3 months safe from self-harm. ‚ô•Ô∏è
I know it sounds clich√©, but it‚Äôs crazy how much a walk outside can clear your head and get you back to at least a neutral state, if not a positive one.
I brushed my teeth and washed my face properly for the first time in a while
I want to be hugged. I just want to be hugged.
It's okay if all you did today was survive
Does anyone else feel like they "can't handle" everyday life as well as everyone else?
My boyfriend undressed me without asking. It‚Äôs not what you think though.
Does anyone ever feel like secretly moving away changing your name and ghosting everyone you know?
Just had my cousin's memorial on Zoom, and it was atrocious.
After 9 years of homelessness I have a roof over my head and feel good.
I ate today!
So today I brushed my teeth for the first time in a while and took a shower :)
Is it just me or did everyone's mental health has gotten severely worse since the quarantine?

I need to tell someone that I've been clean for almost a year and I'm so proud but its also the only thing keeping me going
27 days cut free and I trusted myself long enough to shave my legs. I am smoooooooooth. And no nicks!
Anyone else get these short waves of getting all pumped up to do more stuff in life? But then 10 min later remember that basically life is pointless.
don‚Äôt you just love how mental disorders are basically buy one get seven free
Does anyone else feel okay but then one thing just shatters you‚Äôre vibe and you go numb.
I made it 24 hours without cutting myself or drinking
Does anyone else feel like they have so much potential if it weren‚Äôt for their mental illness?
I did it.
‚ÄúDepression is being colourblind and constantly told how colourful the world is.‚Äù - Atticus
After putting off my driver‚Äôs license for four years due to my depression... I passed my test today!!!!!! ü•≥

Does your depression ever make you feel that you're not depressed enough to have depression?
Anyone else feel they have lost so much of their life to mental illness?
Does anyone else get angry about how much effort you have to put in to stay stable?
Celebrating 6 months since I stopped cutting ü•≥
I Woke Up Today And Realised I Haven‚Äôt Self Harmed In 9 Months
Does anyone else get surprised when someone likes you as a person?
Do you ever feel like the more you learn the more depressing the world is?

Does anyone else feel inadequate when compared to others who are their same age?
I DIDNT HAVE A PANIC ATTACK TODAY!!
i‚Äôve been clean from self harm for one year!!
I considered killing myself this weekend. I'm glad I didn't.
It really annoys me when people mock your mental illness in private. Then pretend to be an advocate in public.
I've gone a whole calendar month without any suicidal thoughts
Why is it that every time I have a little inconvenience in my life, my first thought is 'i should kill myself'?

someone take the time to wish me a happy birthday? I don't have anyone and don't want to feel so alone today.
This sub is toxic‚Ä¶
You can sound confident & have anxiety. You can look healthy but feel like shit. You can look happy & be miserable inside. You can be good looking & feel ugly. So be kind, because every person is fighting a battle you know nothing about

We need to stop calling suicide an ‚Äúimpulsive decision‚Äù
I recently read this and I think it might help someone else too: ‚ÄúAlways do your best‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúwork until you collapse‚Äù. If you push yourself past your best abilities you will do worse. Doing your best means knowing your limits and working within them.

does anyone feel more sane / less mentally ill when they‚Äôre obsessed with a tv show or something?
Just because it is (sadly) normal for ppl to experience suicidal thoughts especially at the moment, suicidal thoughts themselves are not normal PLZ STOP NORMALIZING SUICIDAL THOUGHTS
Has anyone been told they were overly passive but when you finally spoke out/stood up for yourself were told (in one way or another) that you were "crazy," "out of control," and should "get help"?
Saw this whilst taking a comfort stop
I finally brushed my teeth!!
Does anyone else just feel like crying whenever you hear stories of people getting mental health support from their parents because you just know you won‚Äôt ever have the same?
If your behaviour has ever been called 'attention seeking'... remember these words.
Took a shower yesterday after 2 months.
Does anyone else with depression (or really any illness or just in general) not even have the motivation to watch shows?

I could really use a hug right now
I haven‚Äôt cut all year!
It‚Äôs been 10 years since my suicide attempt and I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt succeed!!

Does anyone else hate the "If I can do it, you can do it" mentality
Does anyone else get a weird feeling when thinking about how you are who you are and this is ‚Äòyour‚Äô life, ‚Äòyour‚Äô etc... Kind of like realizing that you exist?
I know Im a stranger but if anyone out there is feeling alone, depressed, scared, etc. And just needs a human to connect with, youre welcome to message me. We‚Äôre all in this together.
My depression is really kicking my arse, partly because we're in another Covid19 Lockdown. The only thing giving me any comfort is my cat (I'm single and live alone). Anyone else living for their pets right now?

Movies make personality disorders look quirky and fun. But I'm miserable not knowing who I'm going to be tomorrow.
Has anyone else lost "friends" that made it seem like your mental illness was a bigger inconvenience for them than it was for you?
Repeat After Me
Sometimes I just want to drive off of the road and wreck my car so people will come to my bedside and tell me they're happy im alive.
my abuser is blowing up on tiktok
If you are suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts, this the wisdom I‚Äôve gathered since my suicide attempt a decade ago.
Does anyone else just have that feeling that they want to go home, when they‚Äôre already home?
Recovering from depression really feels like I‚Äôm trying to stay ‚Äúsober‚Äù
I like to think, whenever you "pour one out" for a friend or family member who has passed, in whatever afterlife you picture them in, a cup appears in front of them and they get to drink whatever you poured out for them.
Just spent 15 minutes being berated by a doctor for being on antidepressants, because "they're not good for your brain"
‚ÄúHow‚Äôs is your everyday?‚Äù
Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson shares about dealing with depression: "Make sure you're talking to good people about it. No shame in getting help and wanting to be better."
Did your parent ever say ‚Äústop crying before i give you something to cry about‚Äù?
I feel like my ‚Äútrauma‚Äù isn‚Äôt valid because it‚Äôs not as bad as a lot of other people‚Äôs.
I did it
How I became a happier and kinder person, and accidently started liking myself a lot more
New job! Still homeless but I got a new job! Mental health is on the uptick!
I dont want to kill myself but I don't want to be alive either. It feels like I'm being forced to suffer and the only things that make me happy are just distractions from getting better.
I showered today.
I just had sex for the first time since I was raped
Tired of playing scenarios in my head that don‚Äôt even exist.
Mental health resources are a whole lot of bullshit. Deciding to reach out for help is supposed to be the hard part. Not getting it.
To everyone who's birthday was ignored this year:
Watching all your friends moving on and doing stuff with there life while you're frozen in time and have no motivation to do anything at all>>>>>
Sometimes we need to laugh at our struggles. I hope you all are feeling well today.
They all want to romanticise mental health issues until they have to deal with the problems that come with it.
I think my life is finally looking up. Im excited for tomorrow for the first time in forever.
57 days sober!
I found a suicide note my bf wrote last night and I don‚Äôt know what to do
I hate how people are expected to wait weeks, possibly MONTHS for mental health appointments.
I got connected to the same suicide hotline operator twice
To those whose mothers' love wasn't unconditional
As i slowly understand my current mental state ive also realized that explaining or asking for help to the wrong people can be extremely dangerous.
Anyone else hate telling anyone how you feel because you feel like a burden
Please don't mix alcohol with antidepressants!
If anybody wants to play some video games and vent. I can play/talk with you.
I hate being told to "relax" while having a panic attack
I called a suicide hotline recently and was dismissed because I‚Äôm a man and I have Tourette‚Äôs. üí¶ü¶Ñüòñ
I took a shower for the first time in a month or so.
I got an apology from my old psychiatrist
Why isn‚Äôt there a such thing as an urgent care designed specifically for mental health emergencies?
The life you are living is for you. Do it for yourself. It isn‚Äôt for anybody else. Live for you, honour you & love you. Never lose eye on that
Does anyone else get heavy criticism while have anxiety attacks? "You're overreacting" "fine, just have it your way then if you're going to make it such a problem" " you're ruining this by blowing it out of proportion" "you're not thinking right, so I'll make decisions for you" or is it just me?
I went to a protest and rocked this sign!
I want bad things to happen to me just so I can get out of doing things and take a break.
I made a website for men's mental health.
I cleaned my ‚Äúdepression room‚Äù
2nd day without self harm
Sick of this double standard.
Instead of saying "I'm damaged, I'm broken," say "I'm healing, I'm recovering myself, I'm starting over."
Shocked
All trauma is trauma!
Does anyone else want to get better, mentally and physically but just doesn‚Äôt have the motivation to do so. Like you know you can improve but you don‚Äôt know if you really want to
Virtual hugs to all of you :)
Happy Valentine‚Äôs Day to the ppl with no one
Whoever comes across this, you're doing fine. Just remember that there's a whole community of people who understand and we're here.
My mental health is the equivalent of a dodgy knee. I'm not going to win any marathons but that doesn't mean i can't do one (and finish it in my own time)
First post. I‚Äôve struggled with depression for over 12 years and I rarely put actual emotion, and pain into my art. Last week I completed my first attempt at expressing how I feel waking up lately, struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. Here it is: ‚ÄúThe Hand I Was Dealt‚Äù
I've been struggling with my mental health for years and I've finally been brave enough to make an appointment with a doctor.
6 months clean from self harm!
Maybe the last time I hugged my son.
Tonight we sat and cried together. I forgot I had the power to help people even when I‚Äôm sad. Words aren‚Äôt always necessary.
Last month I attempted suicide for the 4th time. Today I was promoted a week into my new job. It does get better.
For the first time in my life, I talked with a professional about this and was told that I was downright abused and it's like a weight has been lifted off - It wasn't my fault. I wasn't a troubled kid.
I don't wanna die, just don't want to keep living.
I finally got the balls to sign myself up for a therapist!
It's okay to be a male with mental health problems.
Leave a dot (.) If you need some nice words!
To all those suffering today: Have a safe and calm Xmas.
How do I stop creating fake scenarios in my head that upset me?
Self harm free for 10 years!
True
Finally cleaned my room and did laundry after 3 weeks
My husband went into psychosis. I‚Äôm not ok
Isn‚Äôt this the truth!
If you have the power to make someone smile, do it. The world needs more of that.
The power of walking
The popular saying to ‚Äúfollow your heart/instincts/inner voice‚Äù is only helpful for those who have a proven track record of a healthy internal thought process. At 35 I‚Äôm learning that for me this is bad advice and I found that helpful to me to understand i interpret the world differently than most.
My friend died by suicide. Please listen to her wisdom & help me honor her.
Abuse [trigger warning]
Even if it doesn't go away, you can get better at dealing with it
Did any of you ever feel guilty about not doing any (school) work but felt so tired of it you couldn‚Äôt even think about getting started?
Does anyone else have difficulty holding down jobs because of your illness?
Is it rude to tell people my dad died by suicide?
I've started talking to myself the way I talk to friends
This is a battle I‚Äôm going to fight until the end. If I die, I‚Äôm going to die on my feet. My memory and appetite might be quickly declining, (as evidenced by neuropsychological tests). But I‚Äôm not going to die quietly.
We had a protest in NYC called "I'M MENTALLY ILL, AND I DON'T KILL."
Psychiatrist told me that only girls cut themselves
Does anyone else feel like they just don't have an identity since you spend so much time coping with your illness?
Guilting people out of suicide by telling us to think of our families isn‚Äôt the answer!
Today I Got Up
Self Care
I DID ALL MY HYGIENE STUFF TODAY
Can we please let men open up without derailing?
My depression is not an "aesthetic". It's not cute to be a "sad boy/sad girl".
I've been sober for 125 days now!
Does anyone feel dramatic/like a giant burden after they start talking about their emotions?
Why are mental hospitals so fucked up and why aren't we allowed to talk about it?
Everyone who's feeling down today, FEEL HUGGED. Let's wallow in our pain together (ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)„Å§‚äÇ(ÔΩ•œâÔΩ•)
the other day i got a calendar notification on my phone. it said "die"
Went to ocean today , freezing cold but I needed to see the waves, the smell and the peaceful atmosphere
I wanna go home, but I‚Äôm already home.
Why are people like this allowed to be psychiatrists?
Ate without guilt for the first time!
Do you ever feel like you're just so, so starved for human connection
Thinking about starting a subbreddit and or a Facebook group called "MENtality". A place where men can freely talk about their problems, to reach out to each other and help each other.
Does anyone else get uncomfortable when people do nice things for you because you hate yourself?
Does anyone else feel like they sound overly dramatic/crazy when they open up and try to verbalize their feelings? Everyday thoughts that don't feel like a big deal, but sound like they are?
I'm sick of therapists using CBT where it isn't helpful
Does anyone else feel like they are fundamentally broken and never had a chance at being happy?
The saying that mental health disorders are ‚Äúinvisible illnesses‚Äù is the biggest joke I‚Äôve ever heard.
I'm proud of myself
Does anyone else just want to sleep to escape reality
My anorexia recovery
Social media is horrible for mental health but it's the only way anybody talks to me
High schools need therapists and real resources for suicidal students, not just non-suicide contracts
if you're reading this and you're having a bad time, I'm begging you to get help before it's too late
You don't need to "make the most" of this global pandemic
Dear mentally stable people: I‚Äôm not lazy!
It's okay to stay alive and stay healthy for the little things
STOP. ROMANTICISING.MENTAL.ILLNESS
Just want to give a shoutout to the person I love, who finally today, after 32 years, admitted that he needs to go to therapy
I stop replying to people for no reason
Do yoy guys feel like you don't deserve to be with your boyfriend/girlfriend because you feel like a messed up person and don't deserve happiness?
My boyfriend just killed himself
Anyone else just know they will eventually k*ll themselves.
I Made FREE Mental Health Printables! (Planners, Self-Care Tips, etc.)
I tried so hard to love this country, but after all of the racism and indifference I‚Äôve faced, I‚Äôm happy I can finally leave.
Best friend took her own life: the aftermath and everything else
Why people can't understand that sometimes there is no reason?
You made it.
you ever push everyone you used to cherish out of your life because you overthink what that thing they said means when it really doesn't mean that and your anxiety creates false narratives of situations resulting in self destruction?

No Longer Having Suicidal Thoughts
People LOVE to love mental illnesses when it‚Äôs the broken sadness hopeless depression type but won‚Äôt hesitate to send us to jail or get us assassinated for a single slip of the angry uncontrollable emotions type
Someone commented saying ‚ÄúI hope your next attempt is successful you fat fuck‚Äù
Do others also have imaginary lives in their heads? Is it unhealthy?
Today I realised that the negative voices and the constant doubts going round in my head, the bad feelings ect ect aren't me, they're an illness invading my mental space.
Just cause ur black dont mean u cant have mental illness
I‚Äôm almost 24 and feel like I‚Äôve wasted my life overthinking, being anxious or depressed, having no direction in life, wanting to cut or commit suicide, being emotionally isolated from family, having no social life, feeling angry all the time, wasting money on a useless degree‚Ä¶
RIP üíî

Threw out a self harm tool.
sitting on my bed with my blanket over my head and body while playing animal crossing has become my new way of coping
Changing the way you speak helps to change your perspective.
My depression is lifting. I haven't felt this happy in 3 years.
Does anyone else overly explain themselves about almost anything and or say sorry WAY TOO MUCH?
Who can relate?
Tell someone who is freaking out to "take a deep breath" instead of "calm down"
Everyone cares so much about mental health until it comes to parts that aren't romanticized.
I'm struggling with something and I'm not even sure what to call it, so please help

My experience in a psych ward

My dad told me I‚Äôm getting ‚Äòfatter‚Äô. I didn‚Äôt finished eating. Weighed myself (no weight movement). Went to the toilet and forced vomit. I just don‚Äôt want to eat anymore. They know I‚Äôm bulimic for almost a decade. Work from home is affecting my mental health and hearing those words made it worse.
Give yourself the same love and affection you give to other people and watch yourself blossom to something special
I wish that therapy wasn‚Äôt so outrageously expensive in the US.
Life gets a whole lot better when you stop waiting for other people to love you and start loving yourself
If you were given the chance of not have ever been born, would you say yes?
I feel bad that many posts in this group don't get many replies. lets try reply to two other posts for every post we put!
Did anyone feel worse after admitting you're not ok?

I feel like a burden to my friends when I ask them to talk about my mental health
Was anyone else called a spoiled brat growing up (or anything close to that) but now realize it was a mixture of poor parenting and undiagnosed mental health issues?
Have anxiety -> go on meds -> no more anxiety -> go off meds -> have anxiety
Going from extremely horny to feeling numb to being sad to feeling nervous and anxious to being on the verge of crying and having a mental breakdown to feeling sad and being unmotivated to feeling extremely angry is completely exhausting
A toddler said hi to me today and it made me feel human.
Why does my (20m) mind immediately default to suicide when something bad happens to me?

People in their 20s: Ever feel like running out of time?
Animals know

Stop over-emoting at funerals and stop burdening children with adult emotions.
I actually took care of myself today
How many people are we going to lose to suicide due to this quarantine?
Anyone here indifferent to being alive but not suicidal?
I have been really happy lately
I think I was/am an unintentionally toxic person and its torturing me
I finally told my mom
Parents kept my mental illness a secret from me for 3 years. I had early onset childhood Schizophrenia at age 12. How do you think parents should go about breaking the news to a young child?
The cost for inpatient mental health treatment is fucking shameful.
To everyone struggling to go to school or work this morning,

To anyone who needs to see this: you are not your past trauma.
Does anyone else feel guilty for their struggles with mental health?
1 year clean!!
Mental health has no direct ‚Äúcure‚Äù and a lot of the times I think we have to figure it out on our own. Society doesn‚Äôt necessarily understand our struggle and we have to try and show them why mental health care is important.
I know it's weird to celebrate but yesterday was the most "normal" day I've had in 3 years
You‚Äôre not a fucking manic pixie dream girl, and mania is not cute
Just about sums it up
I feel like no one cares if you're depressed, but the moment you say you want to kill yourself, they care
I built a free mental health app after being stuck in my tiny studio in NYC

Why do older generation people think depression is something we make up and it's just a western concept?
Let's love ourselves as well as each other. (x-post blackpeopletwitter)
This mirror constantly made me feel like shit. Olanzapine and effexor has ruined my skin and I've put on a decent amount of weight. I hate what was looking back at me. So I did the only thing I can do well. Painted the mirror. I hate it less now.
Small accomplished but Showered and brushed my teeth for the first time in a week
It's been a month since I decided not to kill myself.
Anyone slowly realize they were very talented at something just to have mental illness destroy everything?
Today, I managed.

I haven‚Äôt self harmed in over a month, I almost did today, but I stopped myself.
How do I(22F) get over the trauma that a kid(9F) put me through?
If your compassion doesn't include yourself, it's incomplete - be as kind and understanding to yourself as you would be to a friend who is suffering
(23F) It‚Äôs so hard processing mental illness in the Black Community.
Six months after my suicide attempt, I‚Äôm traveling alone and loving life.
I went on a run today!
Well, I finally did it. I told my mom I want to start therapy.
What do you think life is like for people who don‚Äôt struggle with mental illness at all?
We need to change the way we talk about anxiety and depression.
Friendly reminder: just because you feel fine on your meds, doesn't mean you'll feel the same without them.
I was approved!!
Has anyone else had depression and other mental illnesses for so much of your life that you feel like it's part of your identity and as much as you hate it you can't imagine yourself without it?
Does anyone else feel "addicted" to their depression...?

I‚Äôm starting to understand why people love life. Just after 1 week of lexapro.
I made an appointment
I unsubbed from every sub and YouTube channel I perceived as being based on negativity, including all political subs.
I feel so unproductive and cannot motivate myself to be productive
Spending Christmas alone in bed with beer and joints, feels amazing not having the pressures of my shitty family around. Fuck them if they're not a positive part of your life.

The medical system in the United States is awful.
Being lonely in the 21st Century where we are living in a super-connected world is fricking hard, mentally taxing and it burns me out

You are right on time.
Ignoring Instagram for the sake of your Depression
This sub is flooded with people asking for help with no one there to give it.
Does anyone else hate how people throw around the terms "narcissist" and "sociopath" on Reddit?
Mental illness isn‚Äôt a choice, we don‚Äôt wake up one day and say ‚ÄúHey you know what?! I want to start hearing voices in my head. That sounds like a great idea! Let‚Äôs throw in some anxiety and a dash of depression while we‚Äôre at it!‚Äù
I just want a test that tells me what‚Äôs wrong with me and how to fix it, is that too much to ask?
If Simone Biles can take a mental health day, so can you.
I actually can't stand the saying "Happiness is a choice".
